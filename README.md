# Ably Features Specification

[![Check](https://github.com/ably/specification/actions/workflows/check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ably/specification/actions/workflows/check.yaml)

_[Ably](https://ably.com) is the platform that powers synchronized digital experiences in realtime. Whether attending an event in a virtual venue, receiving realtime financial information, or monitoring live car performance data – consumers simply expect realtime digital experiences as standard. Ably provides a suite of APIs to build, extend, and deliver powerful digital experiences in realtime for more than 250 million devices across 80 countries each month. Organizations like Bloomberg, HubSpot, Verizon, and Hopin depend on Ably’s platform to offload the growing complexity of business-critical realtime data synchronization at global scale. For more information, see the [Ably documentation](https://ably.com/documentation)._

## Overview

This repository has been created as the new home for the 'features spec' that describes the interfaces, implementation details and behaviours of SDKs (sometimes referred to as client libraries) that provide application developers with support to integrate and leverage the Ably platform in their solutions.

## Versioning

The version for all source contained within this repository as well as all artifacts generated or built from it is defined in [package.json](package.json).
See [Release Process](CONTRIBUTING.md#release-process) for more details.

## Future Direction for Specification Point Adherence Tracking

We have
[this Google Sheets document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZbAfImxRLRKZNe4KPX7b_0BVVI-qyqnvbAco5TFWSQU/edit?usp=sharing)
which has been used at Ably, by client library SDK developers,
to indicate adherence to individual
[feature specification points](https://sdk.ably.com/builds/ably/specification/main/features/)
by their
SDK source codebase.
_Request permission from your Manager if you would like access to this spreadsheet._

The detail captured in that spreadsheet is an important source of information which should be able to help us understand the level of features specification compliance across our SDKs. As such, it should be considered a valuable source of truth when it comes to working out what features are implemented across our SDKs.

Additionally, it is very likely that we will continue to want to track feature specification point adherence, at that level of fine granularity, going forwards.

What is clear, however, is that a Google Sheets document is probably not the appropriate venue to continue tracking this information. Instead, the currently anticipated solution is that we export the information per-SDK from that spreadsheet and represent it in a simple format as a 'feature specification point adherence checklist' (/ manifest) in each SDK source code repository (CSV, YAML or some other logical textual data format). This would be instantiated via an initial snapshot process, after which it could be evolved atomically as an additional part of the source code of that SDK, with the spreadsheet becoming obsolete once all SDKs have been exported.

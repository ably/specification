# Content Move from `ably/docs`

## Overview

On 20 September 2022 this [`textile/` folder](./) was pushed to this repository, along with Git commit history relating only to the files contained within.

## How

All steps carried out by [Quintin Willison](https://github.com/QuintinWillison), exactly as described below...

First, the [git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) tool was used.
It was installed on local machine (macOS 12.2.1) via Homebrew with:

    brew install git-filter-repo

And then a local, clean clone of the `ably/docs` repository was made in a temporary folder and the tool was run with:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e

git clone git@github.com:ably/docs.git

cd docs

git rev-parse HEAD
git rev-parse --short HEAD

git filter-repo \
    --path content/client-lib-development-guide/ \
    --path-rename 'content/client-lib-development-guide/':'textile/'
```

Generating the following output:

```

```

To combine this with this repository, [these instructions](https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/git-combine/) were used...

Then, from a local up-to-date instance of this repository, a temporary remote was added using:

    git remote add temp-docs ~/code/TEMP/docs

A `git fetch` was run:

    git fetch temp-docs

And the merge commit then created:

    git merge temp-docs/main --allow-unrelated-histories

And then pushed to `origin` (GitHub, this repository).

## Issues Transfer

All steps carried out by [Quintin Willison](https://github.com/QuintinWillison), exactly as described below...

Using [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) and [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq)...

First, discovering that there were 74 issues in `ably/docs` with the `client-lib-spec` label:

    gh issue list --label client-lib-spec --limit 100

The output of that command is human readable.
The next step was to get it in JSON form:

    gh issue list --label client-lib-spec --limit 100 --json number > client-lib-spec-issue-numbers.json

Generating `client-lib-spec-issue-numbers.json` with the following contents:

```json
[{"number":1607},{"number":1568},{"number":1484},{"number":1476},{"number":1425},{"number":1416},{"number":1347},{"number":1329},{"number":1326},{"number":1291},{"number":1290},{"number":1289},{"number":1288},{"number":1251},{"number":1244},{"number":1165},{"number":1149},{"number":1103},{"number":1100},{"number":1076},{"number":1072},{"number":1069},{"number":1046},{"number":1043},{"number":1000},{"number":991},{"number":984},{"number":977},{"number":976},{"number":918},{"number":895},{"number":894},{"number":891},{"number":889},{"number":805},{"number":791},{"number":762},{"number":754},{"number":705},{"number":693},{"number":669},{"number":667},{"number":652},{"number":646},{"number":628},{"number":627},{"number":619},{"number":595},{"number":577},{"number":566},{"number":543},{"number":468},{"number":467},{"number":455},{"number":435},{"number":429},{"number":425},{"number":404},{"number":391},{"number":359},{"number":349},{"number":343},{"number":335},{"number":334},{"number":332},{"number":326},{"number":325},{"number":280},{"number":263},{"number":224},{"number":202},{"number":149},{"number":141},{"number":36}]
```

Next was to extract just the issue numbers from that JSON document:

    jq '.[] | .number' < client-lib-spec-issue-numbers.json > client-lib-spec-issue-numbers.txt

Then create a script file containing the commands to be run to perform the issue transfers to their new home in the `ably/specification` repository:

    sed -E "s/^(.*)$/gh issue transfer \1 ably\/specification/g" < client-lib-spec-issue-numbers.txt > transfer-client-lib-spec-issues.sh

Then make that script file executable and run it:

```
docs % chmod +x transfer-client-lib-spec-issues.sh
docs % ./transfer-client-lib-spec-issues.sh

```

My working theory was that the failures were perhaps due to rate limiting.
I suspect that may have been the case, as simply running thru the whole process again from the top resulted in success:

h2(#overview). Overview

This document outlines the feature specification for the Objects feature of the Realtime system. It is currently under development and stored separately from the main specification to simplify the initial implementation of the feature in other SDKs. Once completed, it will be moved to the main "features":../features spec.

Objects feature enables clients to store shared data as "objects" on a channel. When an object is updated, changes are automatically propagated to all subscribed clients in realtime, ensuring each client always sees the latest state.

h3(#realtime-objects). RealtimeObjects

* @(RTO1)@ @RealtimeObjects#getRoot@ function:
** @(RTO1a)@ Requires the @OBJECT_SUBSCRIBE@ channel mode to be granted per "RTO2":#RTO2
** @(RTO1b)@ If the channel is in the @DETACHED@ or @FAILED@ state, the library should throw an @ErrorInfo@ error with @statusCode@ 400 and @code@ 90001
** @(RTO1c)@ If the "RTO17":#RTO17 sync state is not @SYNCED@, waits for the sync state to transition to @SYNCED@
** @(RTO1d)@ Returns the object with id @root@ from the internal @ObjectsPool@ as a @LiveMap@
* @(RTO11)@ @RealtimeObjects#createMap@ function:
** @(RTO11a)@ Expects the following arguments:
*** @(RTO11a1)@ @entries@ @Dict<String, Boolean | Binary | Number | String | JsonArray | JsonObject | LiveCounter | LiveMap>@ (optional) - the initial entries for the new @LiveMap@ object
** @(RTO11b)@ The return type is a @LiveMap@, which is returned once the required I/O has successfully completed
** @(RTO11c)@ Requires the @OBJECT_PUBLISH@ channel mode to be granted per "RTO2":#RTO2
** @(RTO11d)@ If the channel is in the @DETACHED@, @FAILED@ or @SUSPENDED@ state, the library should throw an @ErrorInfo@ error with @statusCode@ 400 and @code@ 90001
** @(RTO11e)@ If "@echoMessages@":../features#TO3h client option is @false@, the library should throw an @ErrorInfo@ error with @statusCode@ 400 and @code@ 40000, indicating that @echoMessages@ must be enabled for this operation
** @(RTO11f)@ Creates an @ObjectMessage@ for a @MAP_CREATE@ action in the following way:
*** @(RTO11f1)@ If @entries@ is null or not of type @Dict@, the library should throw an @ErrorInfo@ error with @statusCode@ 400 and @code@ 40003, indicating that @entries@ must be a @Dict@. Note that @entries@ is an optional argument, and if omitted, this error must not be thrown
*** @(RTO11f2)@ If any of the keys provided in @entries@ are not of type @String@, the library should throw an @ErrorInfo@ error with @statusCode@ 400 and @code@ 40003, indicating that keys must be @String@
*** @(RTO11f3)@ If any of the values provided in @entries@ are not of an expected type, the library should throw an @ErrorInfo@ error with @statusCode@ 400 and @code@ 40013, indicating that such data type is unsupported
*** @(RTO11f4)@ Create a partial @ObjectOperation@ with the initial value for the new @LiveMap@:
**** @(RTO11f4a)@ Set @ObjectOperation.map.semantics@ to @ObjectsMapSemantics.LWW@
**** @(RTO11f4b)@ Set @ObjectOperation.map.entries@ to an empty map if @entries@ is omitted
**** @(RTO11f4c)@ Otherwise, set @ObjectOperation.map.entries@ based on the provided @entries@. For each key-value pair in @entries@:
***** @(RTO11f4c1)@ Create an @ObjectsMapEntry@ for the current value:
****** @(RTO11f4c1a)@ If the value is of type @LiveCounter@ or @LiveMap@, set @ObjectsMapEntry.data.objectId@ to the @objectId@ of that object
****** @(RTO11f4c1b)@ If the value is of type @JsonArray@ or @JsonObject@, set @ObjectsMapEntry.data.json@ to that value
****** @(RTO11f4c1c)@ If the value is of type @String@, set @ObjectsMapEntry.data.string@ to that value
****** @(RTO11f4c1d)@ If the value is of type @Number@, set @ObjectsMapEntry.data.number@ to that value
****** @(RTO11f4c1e)@ If the value is of type @Boolean@, set @ObjectsMapEntry.data.boolean@ to that value
****** @(RTO11f4c1f)@ If the value is of type @Binary@, set @ObjectsMapEntry.data.bytes@ to that value
***** @(RTO11f4c2)@ Add a new entry to @ObjectOperation.map.entries@ with the current key and the created @ObjectsMapEntry@ as the value
*** @(RTO11f5)@ Create an initial value JSON string as described in "RTO13":#RTO13, passing in the partial @ObjectOperation@ from "RTO11f4":#RTO11f4
*** @(RTO11f6)@ Create a unique string nonce with 16+ characters; the nonce is used to ensure object ID uniqueness across clients
*** @(RTO11f7)@ Get the current server time as described in "RTO16":#RTO16
*** @(RTO11f8)@ Create an @objectId@ for the new @LiveMap@ object as described in "RTO14":#RTO14, passing in @map@ string as the @type@, the initial value JSON string from "RTO11f5":#RTO11f5, the nonce from "RTO11f6":#RTO11f6, and the server time from "RTO11f7":#RTO11f7
*** @(RTO11f9)@ Set @ObjectMessage.operation.action@ to @ObjectOperationAction.MAP_CREATE@
*** @(RTO11f10)@ Set @ObjectMessage.operation.objectId@ to the @objectId@ created in "RTO11f8":#RTO11f8
*** @(RTO11f11)@ Set @ObjectMessage.operation.nonce@ to the nonce value created in "RTO11f6":#RTO11f6
*** @(RTO11f12)@ Set @ObjectMessage.operation.initialValue@ to the JSON string created in "RTO11f5":#RTO11f5
*** @(RTO11f13)@ Merge values from the partial @ObjectOperation@ created in "RTO11f4":#RTO11f4 into @ObjectMessage.operation@
** @(RTO11g)@ Publishes the @ObjectMessage@ from "RTO11f":#RTO11f using "@RealtimeObjects#publish@":#RTO15, passing the @ObjectMessage@ as a single element in the array
*** @(RTO11g1)@ The client library waits for the publish operation I/O to complete. On failure, an error is returned to the caller; on success, the @createMap@ operation continues
** @(RTO11h)@ Returns a @LiveMap@ instance:
*** @(RTO11h1)@ While waiting for the publish operation to complete in "RTO11g1":#RTO11g1, the client library may have already received the echoed @ObjectMessage@ operation, as it could arrive before the @ACK@ for the publish operation. Depending on the threading and/or asynchronous model of the client library, this could mean that the @ObjectMessage@ for the @MAP_CREATE@ operation has already been processed, and the new @LiveMap@ instance already exists in the internal @ObjectsPool@. As such, the following checks are performed to determine whether the instance already exists
*** @(RTO11h2)@ If an object with the @ObjectMessage.operation.objectId@ exists in the internal @ObjectsPool@, return it
*** @(RTO11h3)@ Otherwise, if the object does not exist in the internal @ObjectsPool@:
**** @(RTO11h3a)@ Create a zero-value @LiveMap@ (per "RTLM4":#RTLM4), set its @objectId@ to @ObjectMessage.operation.objectId@, set its @semantics@ to @ObjectMessage.operation.map.semantics@, and merge the initial value as described in "RTLM17":#RTLM17, passing in @ObjectMessage.operation@
**** @(RTO11h3b)@ Add the created @LiveMap@ instance to the internal @ObjectsPool@
**** @(RTO11h3c)@ Return the created @LiveMap@ instance
* @(RTO12)@ @RealtimeObjects#createCounter@ function:
** @(RTO12a)@ Expects the following arguments:
*** @(RTO12a1)@ @count@ @Number@ (optional) - the initial count for the new @LiveCounter@ object
** @(RTO12b)@ The return type is a @LiveCounter@, which is returned once the required I/O has successfully completed
** @(RTO12c)@ Requires the @OBJECT_PUBLISH@ channel mode to be granted per "RTO2":#RTO2
** @(RTO12d)@ If the channel is in the @DETACHED@, @FAILED@ or @SUSPENDED@ state, the library should throw an @ErrorInfo@ error with @statusCode@ 400 and @code@ 90001
** @(RTO12e)@ If "@echoMessages@":../features#TO3h client option is @false@, the library should throw an @ErrorInfo@ error with @statusCode@ 400 and @code@ 40000, indicating that @echoMessages@ must be enabled for this operation
** @(RTO12f)@ Creates an @ObjectMessage@ for a @COUNTER_CREATE@ action in the following way:
*** @(RTO12f1)@ If @count@ is null, not of type @Number@, or not a finite number, the library should throw an @ErrorInfo@ error with @statusCode@ 400 and @code@ 40003, indicating that @count@ must be a valid number. Note that @count@ is an optional argument, and if omitted, this error must not be thrown
*** @(RTO12f2)@ Create a partial @ObjectOperation@ with the initial value for the new @LiveCounter@:
**** @(RTO12f2a)@ Set @ObjectOperation.counter.count@ to 0 if @count@ is omitted
**** @(RTO12f2b)@ Otherwise, set @ObjectOperation.counter.count@ to the provided @count@ value
*** @(RTO12f3)@ Create an initial value JSON string as described in "RTO13":#RTO13, passing in the partial @ObjectOperation@ from "RTO12f2":#RTO12f2
*** @(RTO12f4)@ Create a unique string nonce with 16+ characters; the nonce is used to ensure object ID uniqueness across clients
*** @(RTO12f5)@ Get the current server time as described in "RTO16":#RTO16
*** @(RTO12f6)@ Create an @objectId@ for the new @LiveCounter@ object as described in "RTO14":#RTO14, passing in @counter@ string as the @type@, the initial value JSON string from "RTO12f3":#RTO12f3, the nonce from "RTO12f4":#RTO12f4, and the server time from "RTO12f5":#RTO12f5
*** @(RTO12f7)@ Set @ObjectMessage.operation.action@ to @ObjectOperationAction.COUNTER_CREATE@
*** @(RTO12f8)@ Set @ObjectMessage.operation.objectId@ to the @objectId@ created in "RTO12f6":#RTO12f6
*** @(RTO12f9)@ Set @ObjectMessage.operation.nonce@ to the nonce value created in "RTO12f4":#RTO12f4

*** @(RTO12f11)@ Merge values from the partial @ObjectOperation@ created in "RTO12f2":#RTO12f2 into @ObjectMessage.operation@
** @(RTO12g)@ Publishes the @ObjectMessage@ from "RTO12f":#RTO12f using "@RealtimeObjects#publish@":#RTO15, passing the @ObjectMessage@ as a single element in the array
*** @(RTO12g1)@ The client library waits for the publish operation I/O to complete. On failure, an error is returned to the caller; on success, the @createCounter@ operation continues
** @(RTO12h)@ Returns a @LiveCounter@ instance:
*** @(RTO12h1)@ While waiting for the publish operation to complete in "RTO12g1":#RTO12g1, the client library may have already received the echoed @ObjectMessage@ operation, as it could arrive before the @ACK@ for the publish operation. Depending on the threading and/or asynchronous model of the client library, this could mean that the @ObjectMessage@ for the @COUNTER_CREATE@ operation has already been processed, and the new @LiveCounter@ instance already exists in the internal @ObjectsPool@. As such, the following checks are performed to determine whether the instance already exists
*** @(RTO12h2)@ If an object with the @ObjectMessage.operation.objectId@ exists in the internal @ObjectsPool@, return it
*** @(RTO12h3)@ Otherwise, if the object does not exist in the internal @ObjectsPool@:
**** @(RTO12h3a)@ Create a zero-value @LiveCounter@ (per "RTLC4":#RTLC4), set its @objectId@ to @ObjectMessage.operation.objectId@, and merge the initial value as described in "RTLC10":#RTLC10, passing in @ObjectMessage.operation@
**** @(RTO12h3b)@ Add the created @LiveCounter@ instance to the internal @ObjectsPool@
**** @(RTO12h3c)@ Return the created @LiveCounter@ instance
* @(RTO2)@ Certain object operations may require a specific channel mode to be set on a channel in order to be performed. If a specific channel mode is required by an operation, then:
** @(RTO2a)@ If the channel is in the @ATTACHED@ state, the presence of the required channel mode is checked against the set of channel modes granted by the server per "RTL4m":../features#RTL4m :
*** @(RTO2a1)@ If the channel mode is in the set, the operation is allowed
*** @(RTO2a2)@ If the channel mode is missing, unless otherwise specified by the operation, the library should throw an @ErrorInfo@ error with @statusCode@ 400 and @code@ 40024, indicating that the operation cannot be performed without the required channel mode
** @(RTO2b)@ Otherwise, a best-effort attempt is made, and the channel mode is checked against the set of channel modes requested by the user per "TB2d":../features#TB2d :
*** @(RTO2b1)@ If the channel mode is in the set, the operation is allowed
*** @(RTO2b2)@ If the channel mode is missing, unless otherwise specified by the operation, the library should throw an @ErrorInfo@ error with @statusCode@ 400 and @code@ 40024, indicating that the operation cannot be performed without the required channel mode
* @(RTO3)@ An internal @ObjectsPool@ should be used to maintain the list of objects present on a channel
** @(RTO3a)@ @ObjectsPool@ is a @Dict<String, LiveObject>@ - a map of @LiveObject@s keyed by "@objectId@":../features#OST2a string
** @(RTO3b)@ It must always contain a @LiveMap@ object with id @root@
*** @(RTO3b1)@ Upon initialization of the @ObjectsPool@, create a new @LiveMap@ (per "RTLM4":#RTLM4) with @objectId@ set to @root@ and add it to the @ObjectsPool@
** @(RTO3c)@ An internal @appliedOnAckSerials@ set should be used to maintain a sliding window of serials for operations that have been applied on ACK but for which the echo has not yet been received
*** @(RTO3c1)@ @appliedOnAckSerials@ is a @Set<String>@ - a set of "@serial@":../features#OM2h strings
*** @(RTO3c2)@ It is empty upon @RealtimeObjects@ initialization
** @(RTO3d)@ The @RealtimeObjects@ instance must store the @siteCode@ of the site that the connection is connected to
*** @(RTO3d1)@ The @siteCode@ is obtained from the @ConnectionDetails@ received in a @CONNECTED@ @ProtocolMessage@, per "RTN24":../features#RTN24
*** @(RTO3d2)@ The @siteCode@ value is updated whenever a new @CONNECTED@ @ProtocolMessage@ is received
*** @(RTO3d3)@ The @siteCode@ is used when applying operations on ACK to perform the @siteTimeserials@ check as described in "RTO20a":#RTO20a
* @(RTO4)@ When a channel @ATTACHED@ @ProtocolMessage@ is received, the @ProtocolMessage@ may contain a @HAS_OBJECTS@ bit flag indicating that it will perform an objects sync, see "TR3":../features#TR3 . Note that this does not imply that objects are definitely present on the channel, only that there may be; the @OBJECT_SYNC@ message may be empty
** @(RTO4c)@ Upon receipt of an @ATTACHED@ @ProtocolMessage@, the "RTO17":#RTO17 sync state must transition to @SYNCING@ if not already @SYNCING@. This must occur before performing any "RTO4b":#RTO4b actions.
** @(RTO4a)@ If the @HAS_OBJECTS@ flag is 1, the server will shortly perform an @OBJECT_SYNC@ sequence as described in "RTO5":#RTO5
** @(RTO4b)@ If the @HAS_OBJECTS@ flag is 0 or there is no @flags@ field, the sync sequence must be considered complete immediately, and the client library must perform the following actions in order:
*** @(RTO4b1)@ All objects except the one with id @root@ must be removed from the internal @ObjectsPool@
*** @(RTO4b2)@ The data for the @LiveMap@ with id @root@ must be cleared by setting it to a zero-value per "RTLM4":#RTLM4. Note that the client SDK must not create a new @LiveMap@ instance with id @root@; it must only clear the internal data of the existing @LiveMap@ with id @root@
**** @(RTO4b2a)@ Emit a @LiveMapUpdate@ object for the @LiveMap@ with ID @root@, with @LiveMapUpdate.update@ consisting of entries for the keys that were removed, each set to @removed@
*** @(RTO4b3)@ The @SyncObjectsPool@ list must be cleared
*** @(RTO4b5)@ The @BufferedObjectOperations@ list must be cleared
*** @(RTO4b6)@ The @appliedOnAckSerials@ set must be cleared
*** @(RTO4b7)@ The @BufferedAcks@ list must be cleared (see "RTO21":#RTO21)
*** @(RTO4b4)@ Perform the actions for objects sync completion as described in "RTO5c":#RTO5c
* @(RTO5)@ The realtime system reserves the right to initiate an objects sync of the objects on a channel at any point once a channel is attached. A server initiated objects sync provides Ably with a means to send a complete list of objects present on the channel at any point
** @(RTO5d)@ If an @OBJECT_SYNC@ @ProtocolMessage@ is received and "@ObjectMessage.object@":../features#TR4r is null or omitted, the client library should skip processing that @ProtocolMessage@
** @(RTO5e)@ When an @OBJECT_SYNC@ @ProtocolMessage@ is received with a @channel@ attribute matching the channel name, the "RTO17":#RTO17 sync state must transition to @SYNCING@ if not already @SYNCING@. This must occur before performing any "RTO5c":#RTO5c sync completion actions.
** @(RTO5a)@ When an @OBJECT_SYNC@ @ProtocolMessage@ is received with a @channel@ attribute matching the channel name, the client library must parse the @channelSerial@ attribute:
*** @(RTO5a1)@ The @channelSerial@ is used as the sync cursor and is a two-part identifier: @<sequence id>:<cursor value>@
*** @(RTO5a2)@ If a new sequence id is sent from Ably, the client library must treat it as the start of a new objects sync sequence, and any previous in-flight sync must be discarded:
**** @(RTO5a2a)@ The @SyncObjectsPool@ list must be cleared
**** @(RTO5a2b)@ The @BufferedObjectOperations@ list must be cleared
**** @(RTO5a2c)@ The @appliedOnAckSerials@ set must be cleared
**** @(RTO5a2d)@ The @BufferedAcks@ list must be cleared (see "RTO21":#RTO21)
*** @(RTO5a3)@ If the sequence id matches the previously received sequence id, the client library should continue the sync process
*** @(RTO5a4)@ The objects sync sequence for that sequence identifier is considered complete once the cursor is empty; that is when the @channelSerial@ looks like @<sequence id>:@
*** @(RTO5a5)@ An @OBJECT_SYNC@ may also be sent with no @channelSerial@ attribute. In this case, the sync data is entirely contained within the @ProtocolMessage@
** @(RTO5b)@ During the sync sequence, the "@ObjectMessage.object@":../features#TR4r values from incoming @OBJECT_SYNC@ @ProtocolMessages@ must be temporarily stored in the internal @SyncObjectsPool@ list
** @(RTO5c)@ When the objects sync has completed, the client library must perform the following actions in order:
*** @(RTO5c1)@ For each @ObjectState@ in the @SyncObjectsPool@ list:
**** @(RTO5c1a)@ If an object with @ObjectState.objectId@ exists in the internal @ObjectsPool@:
***** @(RTO5c1a1)@ Replace the internal data for the object as described in "RTLC6":#RTLC6 or "RTLM6":#RTLM6 depending on the object type, passing in current @ObjectState@
***** @(RTO5c1a2)@ Store the @LiveObjectUpdate@ object returned by the operation, along with a reference to the updated object
**** @(RTO5c1b)@ If an object with @ObjectState.objectId@ does not exist in the internal @ObjectsPool@:
***** @(RTO5c1b1)@ Create a new @LiveObject@ using the data from @ObjectState@ and add it to the internal @ObjectsPool@:
****** @(RTO5c1b1a)@ If @ObjectState.counter@ is present, create a zero-value @LiveCounter@ (per "RTLC4":#RTLC4), set its private @objectId@ equal to @ObjectState.objectId@ and replace its internal data using the current @ObjectState@ per "RTLC6":#RTLC6
****** @(RTO5c1b1b)@ If @ObjectState.map@ is present, create a zero-value @LiveMap@ (per "RTLM4":#RTLM4), set its private @objectId@ equal to @ObjectState.objectId@, set its private @semantics@ equal to @ObjectState.map.semantics@ and replace its internal data using the current @ObjectState@ per "RTLM6":#RTLM6
****** @(RTO5c1b1c)@ Otherwise, log a warning that an unsupported object state message has been received, and discard the current @ObjectState@ without taking any action
*** @(RTO5c2)@ Remove any objects from the internal @ObjectsPool@ for which @objectId@s were not received during the sync sequence
**** @(RTO5c2a)@ The object with ID @root@ must not be removed from @ObjectsPool@, as per "RTO3b":#RTO3b
*** @(RTO5c7)@ For each previously existing object that was updated as a result of "RTO5c1a":#RTO5c1a, emit the corresponding stored @LiveObjectUpdate@ object from "RTO5c1a2":#RTO5c1a2
*** @(RTO5c6)@ @ObjectMessages@ stored in the @BufferedObjectOperations@ list are applied as described in "RTO9":#RTO9
*** @(RTO5c9)@ Apply buffered ACKs stored in the @BufferedAcks@ list as described in "RTO21c":#RTO21c
*** @(RTO5c3)@ Clear any stored sync sequence identifiers and cursor values
*** @(RTO5c4)@ The @SyncObjectsPool@ must be cleared
*** @(RTO5c5)@ The @BufferedObjectOperations@ list must be cleared
*** @(RTO5c10)@ The @BufferedAcks@ list must be cleared
*** @(RTO5c8)@ The "RTO17":#RTO17 sync state must transition to @SYNCED@
* @(RTO6)@ Certain object operations may require creating a zero-value object if one does not already exist in the internal @ObjectsPool@ for the given @objectId@. This can be done as follows:
** @(RTO6a)@ If an object with @objectId@ exists in @ObjectsPool@, do not create a new object
** @(RTO6b)@ The expected type of the object can be inferred from the provided @objectId@:
*** @(RTO6b1)@ Split the @objectId@ (formatted as @[type]:[hash]&#64;[timestamp]@, see "RTO14c":#RTO14c) on the separator @:@ and parse the first part as the type string
*** @(RTO6b2)@ If the parsed type is @map@, create a zero-value @LiveMap@ per "RTLM4":#RTLM4 in the @ObjectsPool@
*** @(RTO6b3)@ If the parsed type is @counter@, create a zero-value @LiveCounter@ per "RTLC4":#RTLC4 in the @ObjectsPool@
* @(RTO7)@ The client library may receive @OBJECT@ @ProtocolMessages@ in realtime over the channel concurrently with @OBJECT_SYNC@ @ProtocolMessages@ during the object sync sequence ("RTO5":#RTO5). Some of the incoming @OBJECT@ messages may have already been applied to the objects described in the sync sequence, while others may not. Therefore, the client must buffer @OBJECT@ messages during the sync sequence so that it can determine which of them should be applied to the objects once the sync is complete. See "RTO8":#RTO8
** @(RTO7a)@ An internal @BufferedObjectOperations@ should be used to store the buffered @ObjectMessages@, as described in "RTO8a":#RTO8a. @BufferedObjectOperations@ is an array of @ObjectMessage@ instances
*** @(RTO7a1)@ This array is empty upon @RealtimeObjects@ initialization
* @(RTO8)@ When the library receives a @ProtocolMessage@ with an action of @OBJECT@, each member of the @ProtocolMessage.state@ array (decoded into @ObjectMessage@ objects) is passed to the @RealtimeObjects@ instance per "RTL1":../features#RTL1. Each @ObjectMessage@ from @OBJECT@ @ProtocolMessage@ (also referred to as an @OBJECT@ message) describes an operation to be applied to an object on a channel and must be handled as follows:
** @(RTO8a)@ If the "RTO17":#RTO17 sync state is not @SYNCED@, add the @ObjectMessages@ to the internal @BufferedObjectOperations@ array
** @(RTO8b)@ Otherwise, apply the @ObjectMessages@ as described in "RTO9":#RTO9
* @(RTO9)@ @OBJECT@ messages can be applied to @RealtimeObjects@ in the following way:
** @(RTO9a)@ For each @ObjectMessage@ in the provided list:
*** @(RTO9a1)@ If @ObjectMessage.operation@ is null or omitted, log a warning indicating that an unsupported object operation message has been received, and discard the current @ObjectMessage@ without taking any action
*** @(RTO9a0)@ If the @appliedOnAckSerials@ set contains @ObjectMessage.serial@, this operation has already been applied on ACK:
**** @(RTO9a0a)@ Remove @ObjectMessage.serial@ from the @appliedOnAckSerials@ set
**** @(RTO9a0b)@ Do not proceed with applying this operation. This handles the case where the operation has already been applied on ACK
*** @(RTO9a2)@ The @ObjectMessage.operation.action@ field (see "@ObjectOperationAction@":../features#OOP2) determines the type of operation to apply:
**** @(RTO9a2a)@ If @ObjectMessage.operation.action@ is one of the following: @MAP_CREATE@, @MAP_SET@, @MAP_REMOVE@, @COUNTER_CREATE@, @COUNTER_INC@, or @OBJECT_DELETE@, then:
***** @(RTO9a2a1)@ If it does not already exist, create a zero-value @LiveObject@ in the internal @ObjectsPool@ per "RTO6":#RTO6 using the @objectId@ from @ObjectMessage.operation.objectId@
***** @(RTO9a2a2)@ Get the @LiveObject@ instance from the internal @ObjectsPool@ using the @objectId@ from @ObjectMessage.operation.objectId@
***** @(RTO9a2a3)@ Apply the @ObjectMessage.operation@ to the @LiveObject@; see "RTLC7":#RTLC7, "RTLM15":#RTLM15
**** @(RTO9a2b)@ Otherwise, log a warning that an object operation message with an unsupported action has been received, and discard the current @ObjectMessage@ without taking any action
* @(RTO10)@ The client library must have a process in place to regularly check for objects and map entries that have been tombstoned for a period of time, and release their resources so they can be garbage collected. Tombstoned objects and map entries are retained in memory for a sufficient grace period (at least >2 minutes) to ensure that no late-arriving operation is mistakenly applied to an object or map entry the client has already "forgotten" about.
** @(RTO10a)@ The check should occur at regular intervals, for example, every 5 minutes
** @(RTO10b)@ The grace period for releasing resources for tombstoned objects and map entries is determined as follows:
*** @(RTO10b1)@ It is equal to "@ConnectionDetails.objectsGCGracePeriod@":../features#CD2i received in the @CONNECTED@ @ProtocolMessage@
*** @(RTO10b2)@ The grace period value is updated to match the new @ConnectionDetails.objectsGCGracePeriod@ value whenever a new @CONNECTED@ @ProtocolMessage@ is received per "RTN24":../features#RTN24
*** @(RTO10b3)@ A default value of 86,400,000 milliseconds (24 hours) is used if @ConnectionDetails.objectsGCGracePeriod@ is not provided
** @(RTO10c)@ On each check interval:
*** @(RTO10c1)@ For each @LiveObject@ in the @ObjectsPool@:
**** @(RTO10c1a)@ Check if the @LiveObject@ needs to release any resources, see "RTLM19":#RTLM19
**** @(RTO10c1b)@ If @LiveObject.isTombstone@ is @true@, and the difference between the current time and @LiveObject.tombstonedAt@ is greater than or equal to the "grace period":#RTO10b, remove the object from the @ObjectsPool@ and release resources for the corresponding object entity to allow it to be garbage collected
* @(RTO13)@ The initial value JSON string can be created from a partial @ObjectOperation@ in the following way:
** @(RTO13a)@ Expects the following arguments:
*** @(RTO13a1)@ @ObjectOperation@
** @(RTO13b)@ The @ObjectOperation@ may contain user-provided @ObjectData@ that requires encoding. For example, binary data must be encoded to ensure it can be correctly represented in a JSON string and parsed by the Ably server. Therefore, create an encoded instance of @ObjectOperation@ using the same encoding procedure described for the @ObjectMessage@ in "OM4":../features#OM4
** @(RTO13c)@ Return a JSON string representation of the encoded @ObjectOperation@
* @(RTO14)@ An Object ID can be created in the client library for a new @LiveObject@ instance in the following way:
** @(RTO14a)@ Expects the following arguments:
*** @(RTO14a1)@ @type@ @String@ - the type of object this Object ID is generated for. Must be one of @map@ or @counter@
*** @(RTO14a2)@ @initialValue@ @String@ - a JSON string representation of the initial value for the object, based on the encoded @ObjectOperation@. This protects against Object IDs being reused for create operations with differing content
*** @(RTO14a3)@ @nonce@ @String@ - a random string to ensure uniqueness across clients
*** @(RTO14a4)@ @timestamp@ @Time@ - the current server time. This protects against Object IDs being reused across time
** @(RTO14b)@ Generate a @hash@ string for the Object ID:
*** @(RTO14b1)@ Generate a SHA-256 digest from a UTF-8 encoded string in the format @[initialValue]:[nonce]@
*** @(RTO14b2)@ Base64URL-encode the generated digest. This must follow the URL-safe Base64 encoding as described in "RFC 4648 s.5":https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-5, not standard Base64 encoding
** @(RTO14c)@ Return an Object ID in the format @[type]:[hash]&#64;[timestamp]@, where @timestamp@ is represented as milliseconds since the epoch
* @(RTO15)@ Internal @RealtimeObjects#publish@ function:
** @(RTO15a)@ Expects the following arguments:
*** @(RTO15a1)@ @ObjectMessage[]@ - an array of @ObjectMessage@ to be published on a channel
** @(RTO15b)@ Must adhere to the same connection and channel state conditions as message publishing, see "RTL6c":../features#RTL6c
** @(RTO15c)@ Must encode the provided @ObjectMessages@ as described in "OM4":../features#OM4
** @(RTO15d)@ Should validate that the total size of the encoded @ObjectMessages@, calculated as per "OM3":../features#OM3, does not exceed "@maxMessageSize@":#TO3l8. If it does, the client library must reject the publish and throw an @ErrorInfo@ error with @statusCode@ 400 and @code@ 40009
** @(RTO15e)@ Must construct the following @ProtocolMessage@:
*** @(RTO15e1)@ Set @ProtocolMessage.action@ to @OBJECT@
*** @(RTO15e2)@ Set @ProtocolMessage.channel@ to the channel name
*** @(RTO15e3)@ Set @ProtocolMessage.state@ to the encoded @ObjectMessages@
** @(RTO15f)@ Must send the @ProtocolMessage@ to the connection
** @(RTO15g)@ Must indicate success or failure of the publish (once @ACKed@ or @NACKed@) in the same way as @RealtimeChannel#publish@
* @(RTO16)@ Server time can be retrieved using "@RestClient#time@":../features#RSC16
** @(RTO16a)@ The server time offset can be persisted by the client library and used to calculate the server time without making a request, in a similar way to how it is described in "RSA10k":../features#RSA10k. The persisted offset from either operation can be used interchangeably
* @(RTO17)@ The @RealtimeObjects@ instance must maintain an internal sync state to track the status of synchronising the local objects data with the Ably service.
** @(RTO17a)@ The sync state has type @ObjectsSyncState@, which is an enum with the following cases (note that their descriptions are purely informative; the rules for state transitions are described elsewhere in this specification):
*** @(RTO17a1)@ @INITIALIZED@ - the initial state when @RealtimeObjects@ is created
*** @(RTO17a2)@ @SYNCING@ - in this state, the local copy of objects on the channel is currently being synchronised with the Ably service
*** @(RTO17a3)@ @SYNCED@ - in this state, the local copy of objects on the channel has been synchronised with the Ably service
** @(RTO17b)@ When the sync state transitions, an event with the @ObjectsEvent@ value matching the new state must be emitted to any listeners registered via @RealtimeObjects#on@ ("RTO18":#RTO18).
* @(RTO18)@ @RealtimeObjects#on@ function - registers a listener for sync state events
** @(RTO18a)@ Expects the following arguments:
*** @(RTO18a1)@ @event@ - the event name to listen for, of type @ObjectsEvent@ (see "RTO18b":#RTO18b)
*** @(RTO18a2)@ @callback@ - the event listener function to be called when the event is emitted
** @(RTO18b)@ @ObjectsEvent@ is an enum with the following cases:
*** @(RTO18b1)@ @SYNCING@: Indicates that the "RTO17":#RTO17 sync state has transitioned to @SYNCING@
*** @(RTO18b2)@ @SYNCED@: Indicates that the "RTO17":#RTO17 sync state has transitioned to @SYNCED@
** @(RTO18c)@ Registers the provided listener for the specified event
** @(RTO18d)@ If @on@ is called more than once with the same listener and event, the listener is added multiple times to the listener registry. As such, if the same listener is registered twice and an event is emitted once, the listener will be invoked twice
** @(RTO18e)@ When an event is emitted, all registered listeners for that event must be called with no arguments
** @(RTO18f)@ The client library may return a subscription object (or the idiomatic equivalent for the language) as a result of this operation:
*** @(RTO18f1)@ The subscription object includes an @off@ function
*** @(RTO18f2)@ Calling @off@ deregisters the listener previously registered by the user via the corresponding @on@ call
* @(RTO19)@ @RealtimeObjects#off@ function - deregisters an event listener previously registered via @RealtimeObjects#on@ ("RTO18":#RTO18)
* @(RTO20)@ Applying operations on ACK - when the client library receives an @ACK@ @ProtocolMessage@ for an operation that it published, it should apply that operation to the local objects immediately, before receiving the echo of that operation over the Realtime connection. This ensures that when the promise returned by an operation method (such as @LiveMap#set@) resolves, the operation has already been applied to the local objects
** @(RTO20a)@ When an @ACK@ @ProtocolMessage@ is received for a published @ObjectMessage@:
*** @(RTO20a1)@ Extract the operation's @serial@ from the @ProtocolMessage.msgSerial@ field (see "RTL17":../features#RTL17)
*** @(RTO20a2)@ If the "RTO17":#RTO17 sync state is not @SYNCED@, buffer the ACK as described in "RTO21":#RTO21 instead of applying it immediately
*** @(RTO20a3)@ Perform the standard @siteTimeserials@ check using this @serial@ and the @siteCode@ stored in @RealtimeObjects@ per "RTO3d":#RTO3d:
**** @(RTO20a3a)@ For each @ObjectMessage@ that was published in the original @OBJECT@ @ProtocolMessage@, get the target @LiveObject@ from the @ObjectsPool@ using @ObjectMessage.operation.objectId@
**** @(RTO20a3b)@ For each target @LiveObject@, check if the operation can be applied using "@LiveObject.canApplyOperation@":#RTLO4a, passing in a synthetic @ObjectMessage@ with @ObjectMessage.serial@ set to the @serial@ from "RTO20a1":#RTO20a1, and @ObjectMessage.siteCode@ set to the @siteCode@ from "RTO3d":#RTO3d
**** @(RTO20a3c)@ If the check disallows the application of the operation for any of the target objects, do not proceed with applying any of the operations on ACK. This handles the case where the operation has already been applied due to receiving the echo before the ACK
*** @(RTO20a4)@ For each @ObjectMessage@ that was published in the original @OBJECT@ @ProtocolMessage@:
**** @(RTO20a4a)@ Apply the operation to the target @LiveObject@ per "RTO9a2a":#RTO9a2a
**** @(RTO20a4b)@ Note that the @siteTimeserials@ for the object must not be updated when applying on ACK, as they will be updated when the echo is received
*** @(RTO20a5)@ Insert the operation's @serial@ into the @appliedOnAckSerials@ set
*** @(RTO20a6)@ Resolve the promise or callback associated with the publish operation, indicating success to the caller
* @(RTO21)@ Buffering ACKs during SYNCING state - when the @RealtimeObjects@ sync state is @SYNCING@, ACKs for published operations must be buffered and applied after the sync completes. This is necessary because applying operations on ACK during a sync could result in those operations being applied to stale object state
** @(RTO21a)@ An internal @BufferedAcks@ list should be used to store ACKs that are received while the sync state is @SYNCING@
*** @(RTO21a1)@ @BufferedAcks@ is an array of @BufferedAck@ instances
*** @(RTO21a2)@ Each @BufferedAck@ contains:
**** @(RTO21a2a)@ @serial@ - the @serial@ value from the ACK @ProtocolMessage@
**** @(RTO21a2b)@ @objectMessages@ - the array of @ObjectMessage@ instances that were published in the original operation
*** @(RTO21a3)@ @BufferedAcks@ is empty upon @RealtimeObjects@ initialization
** @(RTO21b)@ When an ACK is received and the sync state is @SYNCING@ (per "RTO20a2":#RTO20a2):
*** @(RTO21b1)@ Create a @BufferedAck@ instance with the @serial@ and @objectMessages@ from the ACK
*** @(RTO21b2)@ Add the @BufferedAck@ to the @BufferedAcks@ list
*** @(RTO21b3)@ Resolve the promise or callback associated with the publish operation, indicating success to the caller. This resolution must have no impact on the buffering of the ACK; the operation is not applied to local objects until after the sync completes
** @(RTO21c)@ Applying buffered ACKs - when the sync completes (per "RTO5c9":#RTO5c9), apply all buffered ACKs:
*** @(RTO21c1)@ For each @BufferedAck@ in the @BufferedAcks@ list:
**** @(RTO21c1a)@ Apply the ACK as described in "RTO20a":#RTO20a, skipping the check in "RTO20a2":#RTO20a2 (since the sync state is now @SYNCED@)
**** @(RTO21c1b)@ Skip the promise resolution step in "RTO20a6":#RTO20a6, as the promise was already resolved when the ACK was buffered
